     * Following the Maven convention, the 'organisation' value is further processed by replacing '.' with '/'.

     * <ul>
     *     <li>Artifacts: <code>$baseUri/{@value #IVY_ARTIFACT_PATTERN}</code></li>

     * </p>
     * <p><b>Note:</b> this pattern is currently {@link org.gradle.api.Incubating incubating}.</p>
     * <h4>'pattern'</h4>
     * <p>
     * A repository layout that allows custom patterns to be defined. eg:
     * <pre autoTested="">
     * repositories {
     *     ivy {
